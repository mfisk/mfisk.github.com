In 2010, we embarked on a multi-year interdisciplinary research project to build AI to detect when cyber insiders (an outside intruder or a rogue insider) are active within a network.
Our approach models normal behaviors from multiple data sources inside a network and detects anomalous changes that are consistent with adversary activity.   This approach demonstrates  aspects of "[third-wave AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O01G3tSYpU)" like explainability and model-based learning of sparse data,  that are more sophisticated and efficient than deep learning.

Our work has resulted in top publications, patents, and [PathScan](http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/advisory/ey-los-alamos-national-laboratory---pathscan), a commercial product.

# Intrusion Tolerance

An intrusion tolerant cyber system can maintain certain performance characteristics even when components have been compromised.
