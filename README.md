# Cybersecurity Artifical Intelligence

In 2010, we embarked on a multi-year interdisciplinary research project to build AI to detect when cyber insiders (an outside intruder or a rogue insider) are active within a network.
Our approach models normal behaviors from multiple data sources inside a network and detects anomalous changes that are consistent with adversary activity.   This approach demonstrates  aspects of  "third-wave AI" like explainability and model-based learning of sparse data,  that are more sophisticated and efficient than deep learning.
